- To add new song in playlist.
- To play the current song manually
- To play built in songs

# MOTIVATION FOR THE PROJECT:
Song has been always a relieving piece of art for the people whether in
stress or happiness. Every melody is made with the combination of
different compositions made from different instruments. One of the
most popular and soothing melodies are of Piano. That comforting
melodies are what we are going to represent using GUI, C# and OOP&#39;s
concepts. Although OOP can represent databases and systems more
properly but giving viewers a touch of graphics is our priority. Hope to
give our viewers a wonderful experience.

# WHAT IS OUR PROJECT ABOUT?

Our project showcases the basic pillars of oops with a touch of C# and
GUI. We have tried our level best to add the basic pillars of OOPS such
as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, exceptional handling and
file handling.
# FUNCTIONALITIES THIS SYSTEM ENABLES TO PERFORM:
With the help of this project, one can be facilitated from the following
operations:
1. ENCAPSULATION: It is used in defining the characteristics of keys in
piano.
2. INHERITANCE: we are inheriting two forms (MyForm, Form1) from piano
project windows form.
3. ABSTRACTION: we did abstraction by using classes of namespaces in form
4.EXCEPTIONHANDLING: If the file is not created so, exception will be
thrown.
5. FILE HANDLING: We are using it to read the existing playlist made by
the user and creating.

# CONCLUSION:
We have tried our level best to provide the mind refreshing
experience to user by the perfect blend of music and visuals so
that every individual can get a chance to know the possible
power of oops with the combination of GUI representation in c#.
